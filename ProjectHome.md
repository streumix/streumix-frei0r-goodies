This project is supposed to host a bunch of C++ plugins for the frei0r video effects API. (http://piksel.org/frei0r/)

It's main purpose is to support and track development of individual plugins. Finished work might go into the frei0r plugin collection. We'll see ...
It currently contains the C++ source code, plain Linux makefiles and special XML GUI files for the Kdenlive frei0r host application. (http://www.kdenlive.org)
